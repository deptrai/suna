# Epic: LLM Auto Model Selection - Frontend Integration

**Epic ID**: LLMUI-001  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Business Value**: High (73% Cost Reduction)  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: Ready for Sprint Planning  
**Target**: Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)

## Epic Goal

Enable ChainLens users to access intelligent model selection through the frontend UI to achieve immediate 50-73% cost reduction while maintaining response quality and providing transparent feedback about model selection decisions.

## Business Context

**Problem**: 
- Backend auto model selection is 95% complete but not accessible to users
- Manual model selection leads to suboptimal cost/performance trade-offs
- Users lack guidance on which models to choose for different query types

**Opportunity**:
- Immediate 73% cost reduction when deployed
- 2-3x faster responses for simple queries
- Improved user experience with intelligent defaults
- Foundation for advanced cost optimization features

**Success Metrics**:
- 73% average cost reduction across all queries
- >60% user adoption of auto mode
- <1% error rate in model selection
- Maintained or improved response quality scores

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| UI changes break existing UX | Medium | Low | Comprehensive testing, feature flags |
| Backend integration issues | High | Low | Early integration testing |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Performance monitoring |
| User confusion with auto mode | Low | Medium | Clear UI indicators, documentation |
