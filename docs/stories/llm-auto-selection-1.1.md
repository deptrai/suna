# Story 1.1: Add Auto Model Selection Option to Frontend

**Epic**: LLM Auto Model Selection - Frontend Integration  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Labels**: frontend, cost-optimization, user-experience  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: Ready for Development

## Story Description

As a **ChainLens user**,  
I want to **see and select an 'Auto (Smart)' model option** in the model selection dropdown  
So that **the system can automatically choose the optimal model for my queries to reduce costs while maintaining quality**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Auto Option Visibility
**Given** I am on the chat interface  
**When** I click the model selection dropdown  
**Then** I should see 'Auto (Smart)' as the first option with a brain icon (ðŸ¤–)

### AC2: Auto Mode Visual Indicator
**Given** I select 'Auto (Smart)' mode  
**When** I type in the chat input  
**Then** I should see a visual indicator showing "AI will select optimal model" with blue styling

### AC3: Auto Mode Functionality
**Given** auto mode is selected  
**When** I submit a query  
**Then** the system should automatically select the optimal model based on query complexity

### AC4: Model Selection Feedback
**Given** auto mode selected a model  
**When** I receive the response  
**Then** I should see which model was selected in the response metadata/badge
