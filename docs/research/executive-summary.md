## Recommendation for Immediate Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Prepared by:** Mary (Business Analyst)  
**Research Method:** Hybrid (AI + Perplexity Deep Research)  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH

## 🎯 The Problem

Our current system prompt is **260,990 characters** (~65,000 tokens), causing:
- High API costs (~$25,000/month estimated)
- Slow response times
- Difficult maintenance
- Poor scalability

**Current optimization attempt:** Reduced to 563 chars but lost critical context, breaking agent functionality.

---

## ✅ The Solution: Modular Architecture với Dynamic Loading

### What It Is
Break the massive prompt into small, reusable modules that load dynamically based on user queries.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Core (700 chars - always)      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Modules (1-3 loaded per query) │
│  - File Ops (1,500 chars)       │
│  - Web Search (1,000 chars)     │
│  - Browser (2,000 chars)        │
│  - Code Dev (1,500 chars)       │
│  - Design (1,500 chars)         │
│  - Workflow (1,000 chars)       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Tool Schemas (filtered)        │
│  800-2,000 chars                │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Total: 2,500-7,200 chars (~625-1,800 tokens)
```

### Why This Works
- **Industry Standard:** Used by Cursor ($50M ARR), Replit, GitHub Copilot
- **Proven Results:** Multiple production examples with 50-90% cost savings
- **Maintainable:** Easy to update individual modules
- **Scalable:** Add new modules without affecting existing ones
